--Task--
We observe the result of three agents as they perform their work of constructing an object.

BEGIN

Pick an arbitrary point on the Einsteinian space-time manifold, call it (0,0), and run a Cartesian grid in four directions with each ray trajectory 90 degrees from its left and right nearest neighbor in 2 dimensions. Label one axis 'x' and name the other axis firstly encountered in a counterclockwise rotation 'y'.

Create three agents who are programmed identically and whose task is to walk, mark, and remember.  Between them, they hold two elastic strings.  Start each at (0,0): one agent (1) walks five units in the positive y direction; two agents walk five units in the negative y direction and walk 90 degrees from their path in opposite directions: (2) in the negative x direction 5 units and (3) in the x direction 5 units.

Remember your location on the grid.

-----**PROGRAM OPERATION [STORE IN DATATABLES]

Store grid values of 1,2,3 into tables.  Column 'x' and column 'y'.

[g1:x,y, g2:x,y, g3:x,y]

Store the distance, d1,d2,d3, walked in the following tables:

[d1, d2, d3]; [d4, d5, d6]

Calculate the distance between 1 and 2, 1 and 3 by subtracting the unknown length by coordinate value 'u'.  Distance g23 is known.

[g12:u, g13:u, *g23:u, g46:u, g45:u, g56:u]

Round the distance, if necessary, to a maximum of five decimal places.

Store grid values of 4,5,6 into tables.  Column 'x' and column 'y'.

[g4:x,y, g5:x,y, g6:x,y]

-----**END OF OPERATION

Draw tight the first elastic string and pin to the edge points (1,2,3). This is the first polygon of three vertices.

Scribe circles with a diameter of 2 units filled with quantity 'theta' centered on vertices 2 and 3.

1: cast a ray that intersects point 'a' continuing to twice the distance walked and mark the edge point '4'. Save the distance (d4).

2: Walk in the +y direction along the string to the grid coordinate (2.5,0) and mark the point 'c'. Return to your previous location.

3: Walk in the +y direction along the string to the grid coordinate (-2.5,0) and mark the point 'b'. Return to your previous location.

2: cast a ray that intersects the point 'c' continuing the ray to twice the distance traveled and mark the edge point '5'. Save the distance (d5).

3: cast a ray that intersects the point 'b' continuing the ray to twice the distance traveled and mark the edge point '6'. Save the distance (d6).

Draw tight the second elastic string and pin to the edge points (4,5,6). This is the second polygon of three vertices.

Mark the intersection of the three rays as the center of mass of the triangle centroid as point 'm'.

This is the Uhoo Carpet.
