The data-management aspect to the ideal algorithm

## Beginnings

In early 2007 I invented the "Uhoo Traveler Algorithm" as a part of my Master's Thesis work at the University of Reading, UK. It has lain dormant since 2010 but has found utility anew in context with the ideal algorithm. At the time, it was couched in an older concept attributed to Archiemedes and published as a way to make inroads into the variety of system logic that composed many of his propositions. The 2008 conference paper can be found [here](https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/1106/).

## Literature
